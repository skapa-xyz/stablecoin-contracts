# EIP-3009 Implementation Plan for USDFC Stablecoin

## Overview
This plan outlines the implementation of EIP-3009 (Transfer With Authorization) for the USDFC stablecoin (DebtToken.sol). EIP-3009 enables gasless token transfers through meta-transactions, improving user experience by allowing users to transfer tokens without holding ETH.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add EIP-3009 State Variables and Constants ✅
- Add authorization state mapping: `mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => bool)) private _authorizationStates`
- Define EIP-3009 type hashes as constants:
  - `TRANSFER_WITH_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH`
  - `RECEIVE_WITH_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH`
  - `CANCEL_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH`

### Step 2: Implement Core Authorization Functions ✅
- Implement `transferWithAuthorization` function
  - Verify time bounds (validAfter, validBefore)
  - Verify authorization signature using existing EIP-712 infrastructure
  - Check and update authorization state
  - Execute transfer using internal `_transfer` function
  - Emit `AuthorizationUsed` event
- Implement `receiveWithAuthorization` function
  - Same as above but require `msg.sender == to` for front-running protection
- Implement view function `authorizationState`

### Step 3: Implement Cancel Authorization ✅
- Implement `cancelAuthorization` function
  - Verify cancellation signature
  - Update authorization state
  - Emit `AuthorizationCanceled` event

### Step 4: Add EIP-3009 Events ✅
- Define `AuthorizationUsed` event
- Define `AuthorizationCanceled` event

### Step 5: Update Interface and Documentation ✅
- Create IERC3009 interface
- Update DebtToken to implement IERC3009
- Add NatSpec documentation for all new functions

### Step 6: Write Comprehensive Tests ✅
- Test successful transfers with authorization
- Test receive with authorization (front-running protection)
- Test cancellation functionality
- Test time bounds validation
- Test nonce uniqueness
- Test signature validation
- Test edge cases and attack vectors
- Gas optimization tests

### Step 7: Integration Testing ✅
- Test interaction with existing protocol components
- Ensure transfer restrictions still apply
- Verify compatibility with stability pool and liquidation mechanisms
- Test with proxy upgrade pattern

### Step 8: Security Review ✅
- Run Slither static analysis
- Run Mythril security analysis
- Review for common vulnerabilities
- Ensure no conflicts with existing security measures

### Step 9: Deployment Scripts ✅
- Update deployment scripts to handle new functionality
- Create upgrade script for existing deployments
- Add verification scripts for new functions

### Step 10: Documentation and Examples ✅
- Create user guide for gasless transfers
- Provide example implementations for relayers
- Document integration patterns for dApps

## Technical Considerations

### Reusability
- Leverage existing EIP-712 domain separator infrastructure
- Reuse signature verification patterns from EIP-2612 implementation
- Maintain consistency with existing code style and patterns

### Security
- Ensure transfer restrictions (no transfers to protocol contracts) remain enforced
- Validate all time bounds and nonce uniqueness
- Protect against signature replay attacks across chains

### Gas Optimization
- Use existing cached domain separator
- Optimize storage layout to minimize SSTORE operations
- Consider batch operations for future enhancements

### Compatibility
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing ERC20 and EIP-2612 functionality
- Maintain upgrade path for proxy contracts
- No breaking changes to existing interfaces

## Success Criteria
- All tests pass with 100% coverage for new code
- Gas costs comparable to reference implementations
- Security analysis shows no vulnerabilities
- Successfully deployed and verified on testnet
- Documentation complete and reviewed

## Timeline Estimate
- Implementation: 2-3 days
- Testing: 2-3 days
- Security review: 1-2 days
- Total: ~1 week

## Risk Mitigation
- Thorough testing of edge cases
- Following established patterns from existing permit implementation
- Incremental development with continuous testing
- Code review by multiple developers
